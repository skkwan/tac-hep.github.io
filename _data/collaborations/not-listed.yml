- name: S2I2-HEP
  url: http://s2i2-hep.org/
  description: >-
    The S2I2-HEP project prepared a strategic plan for a potential NSF Scientific
    Software Innovation Institute (S2I2), which evolved into what became the proposal
    to the NSF for IRIS-HEP. As part of that, the S2I2-HEP project worked closely with
    the HEP Software Foundation to prepare a larger HEP Community White Paper (CWP)
    describing a global roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&D for the 2020s.

  description: >-
    This project ran from 2012-2017 and did an "initial exploration of the key
    technical problems that must be solved to provide appropriate data, software
    and algorithmic preservation for HEP, including the contexts necessary to
    understand, trust and reuse the data." As such, it contributed directly to
    some of the development work performed by the [DIANA/HEP](http://diana-hep.org/)
    project and now as part of the [Analysis Systems](/as) area of IRIS-HEP.
