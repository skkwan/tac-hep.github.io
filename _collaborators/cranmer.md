### Biography

Kyle Cranmer is a professor in the Physics Department with affiliate appointments in Computer Sciences and Statistics. He is also the [David R. Anderson Director of the American Family Insurance Data Science Institute](https://datascience.wisc.edu/kyle-cranmer/) (DSI) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Prior to joining UW-Madison in 2022, Cranmer spent 15 years at New York University.

Professor Cranmer obtained his Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2005 and his B.A. in Mathematics and Physics from Rice University. He was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Science and Engineering in 2007 and the National Science Foundation’s Career Award in 2009 for his work at the Large Hadron Collider. Professor Cranmer developed a framework that enables collaborative statistical modeling, which was used extensively for the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012. Cranmer has established himself as a leading figure on the interplay of machine learning and the physical sciences. He has served as a member of the High Energy Physics Advisory Panel (HEPAP) and was appointed to the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) in December 2022. He was elected as a fellow of the American Physical Society in 2021, and he was selected as Editor in Chief of the journal Machine Learning: Science and Technology in 2022.
